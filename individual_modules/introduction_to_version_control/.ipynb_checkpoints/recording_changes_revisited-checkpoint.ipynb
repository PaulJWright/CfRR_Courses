    "# Recording Changes – Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "- Understand how to incrementally stage changes in a file using Git\n",
    "- Learn to stage multiple files at once in a Git repository\n",
    "- Comprehend how to delete and move files under version control within a Git repository\n",
    "- Familiarize with the commands `git rm` and `git mv` for managing files in Git\n",
    "- Practice making commits with staged changes and viewing the log of recent commits \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Staging in steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The last exercise in the previous episode, Viewing History and Changes,\n",
    "began to touch on an important point about staging changes to files. It is possible\n",
    "to stage some changes to a file, then make further changes to the _same_ file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to start adding content to `Git-cheatsheet.md`\n",
    "about `git diff`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Viewing changes\n",
    "\n",
    "`git diff <files>` — Show changes to files that have not yet been staged.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git diff <commit1> <commit2> <files>` — Show the differences in files between\n",
    "                                         two commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's stage these changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git add Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's add some content about the `--name-only` optional argument for\n",
    "`git diff` to the cheatsheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "`git diff --name-only ...` — Only show the names of files that have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now run `git status`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 6 commits.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to be committed:\n",
    "  (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "        modified:   Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes not staged for commit:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n",
    "  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n",
    "        modified:   Git-cheatsheet.md\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`Git-cheatsheet.md` appears as a file that has both changes to be staged and\n",
    "also further changes that have not yet been staged, which makes sense. From\n",
    "here, we could\n",
    "\n",
    "* commit the staged changes (i.e. the content about `git diff <files>`\n",
    "  and `git diff <commit1> <commit2> <files>`),\n",
    "  leaving the material about `git diff --name-only ...` as 'work in\n",
    "  progress' in the working tree; or\n",
    "\n",
    "* stage the further changes about `git diff --name-only ...`, so that\n",
    "  they join what's already been staged; or\n",
    "\n",
    "* leave things as they are and continue working on files in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a lot of flexibility to make our commits nice and tidy. Let's go\n",
    "for the first option. We make the commit and then view the remaining changes\n",
    "left in the working tree:\n",

    "## Staging multiple files\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be a bit tedious to list out each file whose changes need to be staged,\n",
    "or who's diffs we want to examine. Git provides convenient shorthands to refer\n",
    "to multiple files at once. For example, if `path/to/directory` defines a\n",
    "directory within the root folder of our repository, the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add path/to/directory\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would stage all changes to files that are contained in `path/to/directory` _or in\n",
    "directories descended from it_. (So, for example, both the files\n",
    "`path/to/directory/file1.txt` and `path/to/directory/foo/bar/file2.txt` would\n",
    "be included by the above command.) A particular example is the case where\n",
    "`path/to/directory` is just the current working directory, i.e. `.`. If our\n",
    "current working directory is the root directory of the repository, then the\n",
    "command \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would stage changes to all files contained in the repository root directory or\n",
    "any directory descended from it.\n",
    "This can be a useful to way to grab all changes to all files in a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Caution with `git add .`\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Exercise caution when running `git add .`, because you may end up staging\n",
    "> changes to files you didn't intend to! \n",
    "\n",
    "The above examples work analogously with `git diff` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Pathspecs\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The shorthands introduced here are examples of what are called **pathspecs**.\n",
    "> This is Git's terminology for referring to files, in a way that provides more\n",
    "> flexibility than just listing out all file paths individually. If you look at\n",
    "> the Git help pages for commands like `git add` and `git diff`, you may well\n",
    "> find that the command signature includes mention of `<pathspec>` rather than\n",
    "> 'files'. You can think of this `<pathspec>` entry as meaning 'file paths, or\n",
    "> shortcut syntax for specifying multiple files in one go'. We'll see a bit\n",
    "> more about this later in the course. If you want to read more, check out the\n",
    "> Git Glossary manual by running `man gitglossary` and paging down to the\n",
    "> `pathspec` entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting and moving files\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we may need to delete, move or rename files that are under version control\n",
    "in a repository (i.e. that feature in commits in the repository). Git has\n",
    "specific commands to do this: `git rm` for deletion\n",
    "and `git mv` for moving and renaming. The key things to remember about these\n",
    "commands are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* they only work when applied to files under version control; and\n",
    "\n",
    "* they perform the deletion / move _and then stage the result_, ready for committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Comparison with `rm` and `mv`\n",
    "> \n",
    "> You may be familiar with the Unix commands `rm` (for deleting files) and\n",
    "> `mv` (for moving files). If you use these commands on files that are under version control,\n",
    "> then the changes will be detected by Git but not staged. The `git rm` and `git mv`\n",
    "> versions automatically perform the staging for you. If a file is not under\n",
    "> version control, then you should use the usual Unix commands for deletion and\n",
    "> moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form for deleting files that is under version control is\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git rm <files>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a new file, `rubbish.txt` that we'll put in the root folder\n",
    "of the `git-good-practice` repository. For the purposes of demonstration, we'll\n",
    "commit this file and then delete it. First, we create a commit for the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git add rubbish.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git commit -m \"Add some rubbish to try out 'git rm'\"\n",
    "[main d26a698] Add some rubbish to try out 'git rm'\n",
    " 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n",
    " create mode 100644 rubbish.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we apply `git rm` on the `rubbish.txt` file and check the status after having\n",
    "done so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git rm rubbish.txt\n",
    "rm 'rubbish.txt'\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git status\n",
    "On branch main\n",
    "Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 9 commits.\n",
    "  (use \"git push\" to publish your local commits)\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes to be committed:\n",
    "  (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage)\n",
    "        deleted:    rubbish.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The deletion has been staged, but not yet committed to the repository. Moreover,\n",
    "if we view the contents of the folder with `ls`, we can see the file has been\n",
    "deleted from the file system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "Commit-good-practice.md  Git-cheatsheet.md  README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then commit the deletion to the repository in the usual way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ git commit -m \"Remove rubbish.txt\"\n",
    "[main 5cf8321] Remove rubbish.txt\n",
    " 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n",
    " delete mode 100644 rubbish.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of the `git mv` command is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git mv <source-file> <destination>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that if `<destination>` is a directory, the file will be\n",
    "moved there but keep the same name; otherwise, the file will be renamed to\n",
    "`<destination>`. Note that the directories in the destination path must already\n",
    "exist. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `foo/bar` is an existing directory path from the current working directory,\n",
    "  then `git mv file.txt foo/bar/baz.txt`\n",
    "  will move the file `file.txt` to the new file `./foo/bar/baz.txt` (and stage this\n",
    "  move).\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `foo` is a directory, then `git mv file.txt foo` will move `file.txt` to\n",
    "  `./foo/file.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "* `git mv file.txt newfile.txt` will rename `file.txt` to `newfile.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### Exercise\n",
    "> \n",
    "> We may want to create more 'good practice' files as we go through this course,\n",
    "> so let's prepare by moving `Commit-good-practice.md` to a directory called\n",
    "> `Good-practice-guides` in the root folder of the repository. Make this directory\n",
    "> and then create a commit that moves `Commit-good-practice.md` to this\n",
    "> directory."
