As this repo is used to aggregate several different courses, several different licenses are involved, with each course having their own license. 


All of the licenses for a course are included in the "programme_information" directory, wehre the corresponding license is within the content file for each course. For example the license for "Introduction to Python" is within "intro_to_python".
